# Palindrome-checker
   These are simple snippets of code that when run can distinguish between words that are not a palindrome and those that are palindromes.
## What is a palindrome?
According to Wikipedia:
> A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward
## What does the code do?
#### Main Idea (Applies to all programs)
   First, the program reverses the original string sent to it. After that, it checks to see if the reversed string and the original string are the same, then logs the the output.
